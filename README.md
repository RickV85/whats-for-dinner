# What's for Dinner?

### Context:
This is my 3rd project in Mod 1 of Turing's front-end program and I am currently halfway through the module.
We were given this challenge to build our first entire website from scratch where we needed to apply our knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
I think I spent about 10 hours building the main branch and styling the UI. I spent a few more hours on a branch that would have added a function to save the user chose favorites in to local storage and automatically load them on the next page visit but was not quite able to get that working. I think that would have been a great addition to the favorite functionality I built.

### Contributors:
This was a solo project so I was the only contributor to this project.

### Learning Goals:
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
I think my biggest win is that I was able to build a functional website from scratch. I applied knowledge that I gained from my last project but did learn a lot about CSS and HTML in writing it all from scratch. I think I effectively used browser dev tools to closely match the comp and learned a lot about manipulating design. My biggest challenge was creating a new button when an item was added to favorites that allowed a user to remove it when clicked. My solution is not the best but I think bubbling would have worked better but was not able to apply that effectively. The other challenge was working with local storage. I learned a lot about it but was not able to get it functional enough to merge.
